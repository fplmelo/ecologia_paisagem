# Module workflow

![](/img/class-workflow.png)

Today you are going to understand how this modules works.


# Preparation

First, this is a asynchronous module delivered in using the concept of [FLEXI modules](https://www.ntu.ac.uk/about-us/teaching/academic-development-and-quality/course-design/design-for-online-learning) held by NTU. The idea of having an assynchronous module for teaching stats and research methods makes sense because you'll need time to read and train both before and after the each main session and tutorials.


# Lessons

These comprise the slides and videos recorded by the tutor and intriduce the oibjectives, learnign outcomes and some demonstrations.

## Exercise 1 - Create your workbook

## Introduction

Quarto is a powerful tool for creating dynamic documents and websites. This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a simple webpage using Quarto.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

* **Quarto:** You can download and install Quarto from [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
* **Rstudio:** However, any text editor will work, such as VS Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad++.

### Step 1: Create a New Quarto Document

1.  Open your Rstudio
2.  Navigate to 'File'->'new file'-> 'Quarto Document'.
3.  Save it as `webpage.qmd` or any other name you prefer

### Step 2: Edit the Quarto Document

1.  Open `webpage.qmd` in your text editor.
2.  You'll see some default content, including a title and some example text.
3.  Modify the content to create your webpage. For example:


**Headers or YAML**
An (optional) YAML header demarcated by three dashes (- - -) on either end.



```yaml
---
title: "Hello, Quarto"
format: html
editor: visual
---
```

When rendered, the title, "Hello, Quarto", will appear at the top of the rendered document with a larger font size than the rest of the document. The other two YAML fields denote that the output should be in html format and the document should open in the visual editor by default.

The basic syntax of YAML uses key-value pairs in the format key: value. Other YAML fields commonly found in headers of documents include metadata like author, subtitle, date as well as customization options like theme, fontcolor, fig-width, etc. You can find out about all available YAML fields for HTML documents here. The available YAML fields vary based on document format, e.g., see here for YAML fields for PDF documents and here for MS Word.

**Code chunks**

```markdown

## Welcome!

This is my first webpage created with Quarto.

Here's a simple list:

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

```

**You can also include code blocks:**

Code blocks that use braces around the language name (e.g. ```{r}) are executable, and will be run by Quarto during render. Here is a simple example:

## Example of graphics using R

```{r}
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```



You can produce a wide variety of output types from executable code blocks,including plots, tabular output from data frames, and plain text output (e.g. printing the results of statistical summaries). 

### To use Quarto with R, you should install the rmarkdown R package:


```{r}
#| eval: false
#| include: false
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

Installation of the `rmarkdown` package will also install the `knitr` package so you will have everything required to render documents containing R code.

**And mathematical equations:**

E = mc^2

$$E = mc^2$$

**You can add images too:**

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://quarto.org/quarto.png")
```


**Explanation of the code:**

  * `---`
    
    `title: "My First Quarto Webpage"`
    
    `format: html`
    
    `--- `
  
  This is the YAML header, which sets the title of your webpage and specifies the output format (HTML in this case).
  
  * `## Welcome!` : This is a level 2 heading.
    
  * `* Item 1` : This creates a bulleted list.
    
  * ````{r}`: This begins a R code block.
  
:::callout-tip
Use keyborad shrotcut `crtl+alt+i` to create a R code chunk
:::
    
  * `$$E = mc^2$$`: This inserts a LaTeX equation.
  
  * `knitr::include_graphics("https://quarto.org/quarto.png")`: This includes an image from a URL.

### Step 3: Render the Webpage

1. Just click on **Render** button

or

2.  Run the following command to render the webpage:

```bash
quarto render webpage.qmd
```

This command will create an HTML file named `webpage.html` in the same directory.

### Step 4: View the Webpage

1.  Open `webpage.html` in your web browser.
2.  You should see your webpage with the content you created.

## Adding more content

You can add more content to your webpage by editing `webpage.qmd`. Quarto supports various types of content, including:

* **Headings:** Use `#`, `##`, `###`, etc. for different heading levels.
* **Paragraphs:** Just type your text.
* **Lists:** Use `*` or `-` for unordered lists, and `1.`, `2.`, etc. for ordered lists.
* **Code Blocks:** Use ````{r}` to insert code blocks.
* **Mathematical Equations:** Use `$$` for LaTeX equations.
* **Images:** Use `![alt text](path/to/image.png)` or ````{r} knitr::include_graphics("path/to/image.png") ````.
* **Links:** Use `[link text](url)`.
* **Tables:** Use Markdown table syntax.

## Further Exploration

* Explore the Quarto documentation for more advanced features: [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/).
* Experiment with different output formats, such as PDF or Word.
* Learn about Quarto projects for creating multi-page websites.
* Look into adding CSS and Javascript for styling and interactivity.

## Publishing Basics
### Overview

There are a wide variety of ways to publish documents, presentations, and websites created using Quarto. Since content rendered with Quarto uses standard formats (HTML, PDFs, MS Word, etc.) it can be published anywhere. Additionally, there is a quarto publish command available for easy publishing to various popular services (GitHub, Netlify, Posit Connect, etc.) as well as various tools to make it easy to publish from a Continuous Integration (CI) system.

Getting Started
To get started, review the documentation for using one of the following publishing services:
